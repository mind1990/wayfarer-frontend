<h1>Wayfarer</h1>
Wayfarer is an app built using the MERN stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js). Users can provide travel/tourist tips for cities included within the app. The app is a specific demonstration of CRUD methods and state management across a multi-page application.

<h2>Process/Approach</h2>
My team wanted to build a website similar to Instagram, so we decided to build our website with the MERN Stack

<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
The websit still has some bugs such as updating user's profile, following another user and getting the liked posts to show up on a user's profile.

<h2>Biggest Wins/Challenges</h2>
<h3>Wins</h3>
I was able to build the MVP using the MERN Stack as I wanted to and implement some other teachnologies in the app.
<h3>Challenges</h3>
Since I'm more comfortable with Frant End, building a Full Stack app isn't easy for me. 

<h2>Planned Implementation</h2>
I'm planning to implement the following feature where one user can follow another user and change the theme of the app using Sass.
